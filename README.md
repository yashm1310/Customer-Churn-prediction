# Customer Churn prediction
 Customer Churn prediction using Machine Learning
 
 In this project I used various Machine Learning algorithms to predict if the customer will churn or not.
 The classifiers used were:
 1. Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier
 2. K - Nearest Neighbors Classifier (n=3) 
 3. K - Nearest Neighbors Classifier (n=4)
 4. Adaboost Classifier
 5. Voting Classifier
 
 Accuracies of these classifiers were also compared.
 
 K - Means clustering was also used to cluster the customers according to the bills they paid.
 
 Dataset used:-
 churn.csv
